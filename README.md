JP Peng — Quantitative Research Portfolio
Overview

This repository hosts my professional portfolio site and serves as a structured archive of my quantitative research, portfolio analytics, and systematic strategy development work.

My focus is on building production-grade research pipelines that translate statistical insights into deployable investment decisions — with an emphasis on robustness, interpretability, and risk control rather than backtest optics.

The projects presented here reflect how I approach real-world quantitative problems:
clean data → rigorous modeling → disciplined validation → risk-aware deployment.

Research Philosophy

Markets reward process, not cleverness.

My research framework is guided by three principles:

• Statistical validity over in-sample performance
• Out-of-sample robustness over complexity
• Risk management over raw returns

Every project here follows an institutional workflow:

Walk-forward training · strict holdout · cross-sectional controls · transaction cost modeling · realistic execution assumptions

The objective is always the same:
build strategies that survive contact with live markets.

Selected Work
Systematic Equity & Factor Research

Development of cross-sectional alpha signals using:

• Information Coefficient screening
• LASSO / regularization selection
• Genetic Algorithm factor mining
• Barra-style neutralization
• Walk-forward backtesting with Newey-West inference

Focus: stable signals, low turnover, deployable exposures

Volatility & Risk Modeling

Design of market-aware risk engines:

• GARCH / EGARCH volatility forecasting
• Regime detection (HMM)
• Monte Carlo scenario simulation
• Tail risk estimation (VaR / ES)
• Portfolio stress testing

Focus: understanding distribution shape, not just mean return

Portfolio Construction & Optimization

Practical portfolio engineering:

• Softmax weighting / risk-parity approaches
• Factor attribution & PCA decomposition
• Transaction cost modeling
• Liquidity-aware execution filters

Focus: capital efficiency and drawdown control

Technical Stack

Python

What This Site Demonstrates

This portfolio is not a collection of notebooks or academic exercises.

It demonstrates:

• how I structure research
• how I validate hypotheses
• how I document decisions
• how I prepare models for real trading environments

The goal is to communicate both technical capability and professional rigor.
